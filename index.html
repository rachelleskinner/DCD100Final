  <h2>Hi, I'm Rachell
  <br><span>& This is My Relationship with Social Media</span></h2>
  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student studying Digital Culture & Design and Web Application Development with a passion for creating web and design. Social media is a topic that I think a lot about not only from an educational perspective but also in my personal life due to growing up in the digital boom. When social media was first on the rise, I was very involved by interacting with others and posting content. This was due to it being a new technology at the time. However, there was a moment when I decided to take a social media detox by removing all my posts and sort of "started over". Instead, I began to just look at social media, viewing others' content rather than posting my own and interacting. This is how I interact with social media today. However, like many others, this results in poor time management since I waste so much time scrolling. I plan to change my social media habits in the future by creating content to create an online persona for other opportunities. For now, I am exploring more about the workings of social media and brainstorming future content. This project allowed me to get a better understanding of myself by investigating my current social media profiles and which platforms I enjoy more than others. I decided to discuss Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest in this project because these are the only social media platforms I use currently, Instagram being the most used. Although I only "watch" each platform, I use each of them differently. Within each page, I discuss what the platform is, how I use it, what it says about me, and comparing to how others use the platform.</p>
  
  <p><i>I hope you enjoy :)</i></p>
