<h2>What is Instagram?</h2>
<p>Instagram is a social media platform that launched in October 2010 to connect users through sharing photos, videos, stories, and most recently, reels. The platform quickly gained popularity the moment it was released with over 2 billion users today. The rise of users led to various types of content being posted on the application such as personal experiences, news, business, fashion, art, and so much more. Needless to say, anyone can find their people on Instagram. The discovery of this platform became my primary use for social media.</p>

<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>I created my profile during the early years of its release. Similar to others, the birth of my profile heavily differs from my profile today. However, I consistently never posted on the platform throughout the years. Currently, my profile contains a username associated with my middle name, a vague profile picture of myself, an identifiable description, all tied to my first name. I also chose to keep my profile private since this is a personal profile with only allowing familiar people to follow me. This profile customization is meant to present a vague description of myself online. Although being heavily involved in the digital scene as a Digital Culture and Design student, I consider myself skeptical about an online presence. There is a societal standard to everything including social media profiles that puts a strain on social media participation. The pressure surrounding creating the <i>perfect</i> online profile heavily influences me to not contribute to media sharing. I also face the problem of being unsure of <i>what</i> to share to others as well, something other than just myself.</p>

    <h2>Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The main purpose of any social media application, including Instagram is the connection between users including familiar and unfamiliar faces. This is achieved through following others and others following you. Shown in the left image is preview of those I follow, many of which are familiar faces that follow back as well as businesses and content creators. Shown in the right image is a glimpse of people following my personal account, with me verifying each follower to view my profile. Most of my followers are those I have connected with in real life. My followers are from various attended educational institutions, workplace environments, and sometimes random events. Connecting with people online from real life allows us to stay connected outside of related real world environments. Following new faces, businesses, or creators also creates a new connection, expanding knowledge to new things, experiences, people, and content. Although having no posts on my profile for others to view, I stay connected with people by interacting and viewing content created by others. Not to mention Instagram also has a direct message feature that contributes to staying connected as well.</p>

    <h2>Participation</h2>
    <p>Social media participation can vary in different ways depending on uploaded content, profile depiction, interaction with other content, along with the overall purpose of using the platform. Due to no uploaded content (at least yet) along with a vague profile depiction, my participation with the platform differs from the intended use of Instagram. The intended use of Instagram is to connect people by sharing content through different media mediums. Since I do not follow this, the application has a different purpose for me as well as a different form of participation. My participation consists of solely viewing content created by others and the content interaction, such as liking and sometimes commenting. Shown to the right is a glimpse of my feed that depicts the way I participate most of the time. I like to view and interact with non-personal profiles and content, such as art, shops, university pages, etc. as shown in the video. This doesn't exculde the personal profiles I do follow and interact with as well that I know from the real world. I think many others follow this participation style as well since there are various types of content showcased online, especially social media. </p>
