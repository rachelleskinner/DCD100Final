<h2>What is Pinterest?</h2>
<p>Pinterest is a social media service that connects users through image and video sharing. The application launched in March in 2010 and quickly gained unexpected popularity with 478 million global monthly active users today. Pinterest differs from other popular social medias by centering the platform around creating, collecting, and sharing ideas and DIYs; rather than the traditional sharing yourself online strategy that most social medias follow. Pinterest achieves this by mimicking pins on a pinboard. Posts are called pins that users can save to an online collection titled boards for users to go back and view later. User's use this application as a visual diary to discover and collect various ideas and inspiration such as recipes, home, fashion, and more. I downloaded Pinterest in 2014 and continue to use the app daily ever since. </p>

<h2>Profile & Utilization</h2>
<p>Profiles on the platform consist of two tabs regarding pins: created and saved. The two images on the top left depict my usage perfectly with creating zero pins but instead having many pins saved into various boards that I have created to fit my interests. My profile is similar to other social medias I use with no posts, the same username, and also being connected to only my first name. Pinterest also has a following/follower profile feature like all other social medias but I do not utilize this feature at all. This is apparent when looking at this on my profile with zero following. However, my profile does have three followers, none of which I personally know but just acquired throughout the many years I have been apart of the platform. Pinterest has such a good pins algorithm that I do not feel the need to follow creators and can solely rely on the algorithm to view other's creations and content. I love to view and save pins to the various boards I have created, each with a different theme of collected images. I have created 14 boards with ideas such as aesthetic, hair, outfits, crochet, tattoos, makeup, and more, all for inspiration purposes. These boards are shown in the bottom image. I also enjoy using the app to refer back to pins I have saved or in-the-moment ideas. Pinterest's purpose uses a unique social media strategy that draws me towards it more than other social medias since it doesn't have the pressure of posting or being perfect for the internet. Instead, it offers more of a "get out and do the thing" mindset since it is meant for inspiration and ideas. </p>

    <h2>Demographics</h2>
    <p>The image showcased to the right gives a glimpse into Pinterest's users and who they are through numbers. Although there are countless conclusions made about the platform's demographics, here is a snippet of Pinterest's demographics in 2022. Being a 21-year-old adult female in the United States actively using the platform for inspiration, it is apparent my presence on the application contributes to many of the demographics shown in the image. However, some of the statistics surprise me and gives more insight to knowing the users of Pinterest. Before seeing the demographics, I had a tunnel vision perspective of users that use Pinterest, believing that most or a large portion of users are similar to myself. But after viewing these statistics, there is much more to speculate about the users and the platform. </p>
