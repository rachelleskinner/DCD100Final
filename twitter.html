<h2>What is Twitter?</h2>
<p>Twitter is one of the first and leading social media applications that launched in July 2006 that connects people through "tweets". Tweets are Twitter's version of posts that allows a user to upload content including up to 280 characters of text photos, gifs, and/or videos. The platform currently has 330 million active monthly users today as well as being one of the most-visited websites on the internet. The application gained popularity due to its Explore section which keeps users updated on real-world and internet news that some compare to a news source. Twitter got this rep due to the early launch date giving it a head start compared to other social media platforms as well as many people using and/or being familiar with the application. Although I've known about the platform since its release, I began using Twitter in March 2015.</p>

<h2>Profile & Usage</h2>
<p>The images shown to the left showcase each tab associated with a profile, Tweets, Tweets & Replies, Media, and Likes. After the creation of my profile, similar to other social media, my profile has the same username, private profile, and consistently stayed the same with no tweets but still shows who runs the account with a profile picture of myself and my birthday, all being attached to my first name. This can be seen in the Tweets tab (it is covered with a "Who to follow" to promote the algorithm but there are zero tweets to show) as well as under the Media tab. However, this is not entirely true, I have "tweeted" replies which can be seen in the Tweets & Replies tab. Many of these replies are over a year old replying to my best friend, the only familiar person I am connected with on the app but is no longer currently on the platform today. Lastly, under the Likes tab, the most recent tweet I liked was from an account that participates on the platform centered around a certain topic and/or something fun instead of themselves, users similar to this one are the accounts that I usually interact with and follow, similar to other social media I use. This is a common way people use Twitter. I do not use Twitter to connect or stay up-dated with those I know from the real world as I do with Instagram this is why I do not have many followers, differing from typical social media usage. Another way I use Twitter is through their Explore page, consisting of trending topics within the app, the feature that made Twitter popular and stand out from other social media. I commonly use this as a way to stay updated with internet and world news like many others do on the application. Twitter also has Spaces, a live audio conversation feature, as well as direct messaging. I have never used or been interested in using Twitter Spaces or direct messaging, this differs from most Twitter users that do use these features. </p>

    <h2>My Participation Vs. Others</h2>
    <p>After viewing my profile, it is apparent that I do not contribute to Twitter like other users. The image to the right shows recent statistics of tweets that are created and uploaded on Twitter. As someone that never tweets, this is super surprising to me. I'm sure I am not the only active Twitter user that doesn't post tweets but 500 million a day?! Twitter's tweet feature allows users with endless possibilities of what to showcase to the internet and/or followers. There are various types of content mediums that leads to different types of content and/or accounts. This statistic makes me believe that it is rare for users not to tweet. Although I do not upload content, I still contribute through likes, replies (very occasionally), and the act of viewing content on the platform. I do not contribute to the app through tweeting for a few reasons, it is not a part of my routine, unsure of what to tweet, and I fear that others will not care. Posting on social media isn't everything so I do not worry too much about it and do what feels comfortable in the moment. I enjoy Twitter for fun content to view as well as to keep updated on internet and real world news/events like many others do. I do not see myself tweeting any time soon and will continue to view and not talk.</p>
